# Authentication System Implementation

## Overview
The FlightDeck app now has a redesigned authentication system that allows users to browse the main screen without being logged in, but requires authentication for accessing specific features.

## Key Features

### 1. **Public Access to Main Screen**
- Users can view the home screen without authentication
- All main screen content is visible to non-authenticated users
- Airport information, search bar, and general content are accessible

### 2. **Authentication Required for Features**
When users try to access any feature without being logged in, they see an authentication modal with:
- **Message**: "Please create an account or sign in to continue."
- **Two Options**: 
  - **Sign Up** button (for new users)
  - **Sign In** button (for returning users)

### 3. **Protected Features**
The following features require authentication:
- **Tab Navigation**: All tabs except "Home" require login
- **Quick Navigation Tiles**: Food, Shopping, Activities, My Flights
- **Top Picks**: Restaurant and activity recommendations
- **Limited Time Deals**: Special offers and promotions
- **Profile Button**: User profile access
- **Restaurant Details**: Individual restaurant pages

### 4. **Authentication Flow**
- **Sign Up**: New users can create accounts with email and password
- **Sign In**: Existing users can sign in with their credentials
- **Automatic Redirect**: After successful authentication, users are redirected to the main screen
- **Logout**: Users can sign out from the profile screen

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. **AuthModal** (`components/AuthModal.tsx`)
   - Modal component that appears when authentication is required
   - Clean, modern design with lock icon
   - Two action buttons for sign up and sign in

### Modified Files
1. **Tab Layout** (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`)
   - Added authentication checks for tab navigation
   - Integrated AuthModal component
   - Prevents navigation to protected tabs for non-authenticated users

2. **Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
   - Added authentication checks for interactive elements
   - Quick navigation tiles require authentication
   - Top picks and deals require authentication
   - Profile button requires authentication

3. **Food Screen** (`app/(tabs)/food.tsx`)
   - Restaurant selection requires authentication
   - Integrated AuthModal for restaurant access

4. **Authentication Screens**
   - **Sign In** (`app/auth/signin.tsx`): Streamlined redirect after successful login
   - **Sign Up** (`app/auth/signup.tsx`): Streamlined redirect after successful registration
   - **Profile** (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`): Updated logout flow

### Authentication Context
- Uses existing `AuthContext` for user state management
- Firebase authentication integration
- User state is available throughout the app

## User Experience

### For Non-Authenticated Users:
1. Can browse the main screen freely
2. See all content but cannot interact with features
3. Get prompted to authenticate when trying to access features
4. Clear call-to-action with sign up or sign in options

### For Authenticated Users:
1. Full access to all features
2. Seamless navigation between tabs
3. Access to personalized content
4. Profile management capabilities

## Security Features
- Firebase authentication backend
- Secure password handling
- Session management
- Automatic logout on app restart (if configured)

## Future Enhancements
- Social media authentication (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- Biometric authentication
- Remember me functionality
- Password reset flow
- Email verification
- Two-factor authentication

## Testing
To test the authentication system:
1. Open the app without signing in
2. Try to access any tab other than "Home"
3. Try to interact with quick navigation tiles
4. Try to access restaurant details
5. Verify the authentication modal appears
6. Test sign up and sign in flows
7. Verify full access after authentication
